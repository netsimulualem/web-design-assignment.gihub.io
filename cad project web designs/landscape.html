    <h1>LANDSCAPE DESIGNS</h1>

    <P>Landscape design is an independent profession and a design and art tradition,
     practiced by landscape designers, combining nature and culture. In contemporary practice,
      landscape design bridges the space between landscape architecture and garden design.
    </P>
    <p>The landscape design phase consists of research, gathering ideas, and setting a plan.
     Design factors include objective qualities such as: climate and micro-climates;
     topography and orientation, site drainage and groundwater recharge; municipal and resource building codes;
     soils and irrigation; human and vehicular access and circulation; recreational amenities (i.e., sports and water);
     furnishings and lighting; native plant habitat botany when present; property safety and security; construction detailing;
     and other measurable considerations.</p>
