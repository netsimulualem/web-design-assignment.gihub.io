    <h1>INTERIOR DESIGNS</h1>

    <P>Interior design is the art and science of enhancing the interior of a building to achieve a healthier and more aesthetically
     pleasing environment for the people using the space. An interior designer is someone who plans, researches, coordinates,
      and manages such projects. Interior design is a multifaceted profession that includes conceptual development, space planning, 
      site inspections, programming, research, communicating with the stakeholders of a project, construction management, and execution
       of the design.
    </P>
    <p>What is the difference between Interior Design and Interior Decorating?</p> 
    <p>Interior design is the art and science of understanding peopleâ€™s behavior to create functional spaces within a building.
     Decoration is the furnishing or adorning of a space with fashionable or beautiful things*. In short, interior designers may decorate,
      but decorators do not design.</p>
