    <h1>FURNITURE DESIGNS</h1>

    <P>Furniture design is a specialized field where function and fashion collide.Many interior designers believe that furniture 
    is one of the most important aspects of an interior space. Pieces of furniture not only add function and practicality to a space,
     but they also add style and personality.Furniture has evolved and changed with the times, and some styles have remained somewhat
      constant throughout the years, while others have drastically changed or become obsolete. Today, creating new furniture styles is 
      often seen as a type of industrial art form.
